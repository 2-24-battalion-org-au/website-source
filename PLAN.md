## Idea

Make the website more 'human' so we can have multiple people updating it.

Computer code will convert 'human' to the full website.

The website files can then be hosted anywhere, and become the official site by changing the 2/24th domain to point at it.

## Components of the site

  * 'news cards' on front page (added for events, news)
  * photo galleries (add pictures + text)
  * Various mostly static information pages (mostly static)



## Background

A git 'repo'sitory is a working archive which holds the total history of all changes. It can revert changes back or you can see what changed between two points (and who did what).

There will be three repos:
  * one for the 'human' readable version of the site (edit this one)
  * one for the code/tools to build that into the website (use this to convert it from human to website)
  * one for the hosted website (assuming we keep hosting on github)

Github currently holds these repositories (but git works without github). Github does authorisation for us but the repositories are public (for free hosting). Anyone who does a full checkout of the 3 can rebuild the whole site.

# Governance

## Ownership: domain

**ADJ**: add committee as domain owner/admin

## Ownership: hosting

Once build tools are finished, anyone in the association will be able to build the whole site from the repository.

It can then be hosted anywhere (github, amazon, google) and the domain pointed to that.

github can have multiple people registered as 'admin/owner' of the 2/24th group account.

## Appoint/auth members to make changes

Github limits who can edit (but all can see). Any 'human repo' changes are posted to mailing list.

Git keeps a total history so changes can be reverted.

## Develop a regular review process

Changes can be submitted and then accepted or rejected by 'admins'.

Things that need lots of editing:
  * 'news' cards for the front page
  * 'images' with associated comments/text

Less common work:
  * update the spreadsheets which hold the 'offical' rolls (mostly vale?)


# Website content

## Home page review/remove duplicity of topics/links

Partially done. Frontpage now themed like the rest of the site (same links)

## Battalion rolls

Now built from csv from database not hand edited.

TODO: move database of rolls to shared google spreadsheet

## Committee members

update annually (calendar thing? done at AGM?)

## Photo gallery/limited content

"Develop a plan to grow members". News to facebook and website (as cards)?

## FFlyer

Just add to fflyer directory and update fflyer.md? (I could automate this if the ffliers were named consistantly)

## Color patches

"update" ??

## Memorial wall contacts

"update address for orders"

  * get photos of wall
  * update wall plaque csv file
  * Workout what 4W means? (and document on site) (make csv file searchable?)

## consider inclusion of rules

"committee approval required?"

## Identify other deficiences

"develop a plan"

---------

# Other


## Member v public access to info

"Consider weather public searches have access to all info -- any privacy"

What would be members only?

Calendar? Shop?

## Facebook

"Consider opportunity to devlop" (Now have admin, can post/update)
