[Nominal Roll website](http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/)

On this [Nominal Roll site](http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/) you can search by Name, Service Number, Honours, or Place (of birth, locality of residence, enlistment) to see a summary of a person's service record. Once found it is possible to print out a copy.

If the name is known, but not the service number, then click on the Name tab, select Army and then enter as much detail as possible. The more detail, the fewer results.

If the Service Number is known then this will give the details immediately. From this summary a certificate can be printed.
 
## Searching for Service Records on the National Archives Website

On this site you can access detailed service records by viewing online (if available) or purchasing a soft copy of the records.
  * If you do not know the Service Number then look it up on the [Battalion Rolls](rolls/index.html) or look on the Nominal Roll site in the section above.

  * With a soldier's Full Name and Service Number you can search for the service record on the website of the [National Archives](http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/SearchScreens/BasicSearch.aspx). Click on **guest** in the bottom line of the page.

[Note: not all World War II records have been digitised, so all service personnel are not available online. If they are not listed as digitised then it is necessary to purchase the record]
