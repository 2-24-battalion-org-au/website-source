# WE WILL REMEMBER THEM

They shall grow not old,
As we that are left grow old:
Age shall not weary them,
Nor the years condemn,
At the going down of the sun
And in the morning
We will remember them.

-- *Laurence Binyon (1869-1943)*

The 2/24 battalion remembers these members and pays tribute to their memory and give thanks for their contribution.
